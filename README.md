# Contact Form with Nodemailer
This is a simple contact form built with Node.js and Nodemailer that allows users to send messages to a specified email address. It uses the Express framework for routing and the nodemailer package for sending email messages.

# Getting Started
To get started with this contact form, clone the repository and run npm install to install the necessary dependencies. Then, create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add your email credentials. Finally, run node index.js to start the server on localhost:3000.

{ Remember you need to replace the placeholder values in the createTransport method and mailOptions object with your actual email address and password, as well as the recipient's email address. }

# Usage
To use the contact form, navigate to localhost:3000 in your web browser and fill out the form with your name, email address, and message. When you click the "Send" button, the message will be sent to the email address specified in the mailOptions object in the index.js file.
